# Introduction

City Tour is an interactive app/game that we created using OpenGL, where the audience can participate in a virtual tour of our city. Our virtual city is equipped with many types of buildings and magnificent roads. The city atmosphere can also change over time, which affects the lighting and shading in the town. The tour will take the camera/audience around the city by following a predetermined path from end to end. Viewers can see the city using three types of camera perspectives. First, there is a car perspective camera (camera following the streets), a helicopter perspective camera (camera from above), and a free-mode perspective camera (free camera). During the trip, the audience can look around using the mouse.

# How it's made

We did this project by forming boxes (cubes), which we placed with a pattern, and then we gave the squares textures to form a building. The shapes of buildings are made by combining several boxes into one. There are four types of structures that we created, and we put the types of buildings randomly.

We use a skybox for the day and night backgrounds, which is a combination of 6 texture images and forms a 3-dimensional cube map. Skybox will change to day or night according to the time we have set. We also added the sun, moon, car, and people using the texture image and removed the fragments of the parts of the texture that we wanted to make transparent. We also use translation and rotation in our texture image to make it move more realistically.

We also utilized the Camera class from learnopengl.com to create a camera perspective of our program.
The animation for the city tour is done by moving the camera location coordinates to make it move like a car or helicopter.We also employed city ambiance sounds and even car and helicopter sounds according to the camera perspective. To run the background music, we use the Windows library and MMSystem and use the PlaySound function, which plays in the background and loops the song until the application is closed.
